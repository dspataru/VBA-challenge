Module 2 Challenge - VBA Scripting

In this module challenge, a VBA script was developed that loops through all the stocks in a workbook for one year and outputs the following information in a separate summary table in the same worksheet:
  1. The ticker symbol.
  2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  4. The total stock volume of the stock.

The script also creates a high level summary table in each worksheet in the workbook, that contains the following information:
  1. Ticker of the stock with the "Greatest % increase", along with the greatest % increase value.
  2. Ticker of the stock with the "Greatest % decrease", along with the greatest % decrease value.
  3. Ticker of the stock with the "Greatest total volume", along with the greatest total volume value.

The VBA script runs on every worksheet in a workbook.
